fine, just download the dir and do ````chmod +x hackerman````, then do ````sudo mv hackerman /usr/local/bin````, then go download [catzilla](https://github.com/mikhoiuo/catzilla) because obviously you have nothing better to do. no but you need pipeviewer, you can do that yourself since you're such a self-driven little pissbaby.
